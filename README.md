<h1>Color Palette App</h1>
<p>
  Built using React.  Navigation done with React Router.  This app can help the user create and save color palettes to be used in other design projects.

<h2>Reading the Code</h2>
<p>
  I built this project when I first learned React, and I used a ton of class-based components, which at this point are considered old fashioned.  
  However, some of the components are made as function-based components, to allow the use of the Material UI library, which is no longer supported by React's class-based   structure. Even still, some of the CSS is written in JS, but most of it is in separate files. The end result is a bit of a frankenstein that could use some 
  refactoring, sorry.
